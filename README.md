Iulia's Priority list

The main focus for this project is to create from scratch a HTML + CSS + JavaScript webpage that will contain a priority list for the work tasks.
There are some rules that we need to keep in mind while doing this.

The list will contain 2 sections. 

FIRST SECTION:
This section will contain a list with 3 tasks, the top priority tasks. In front of each row(task) there will be a box that will be clicked and checked each time a task will be completed. The following task will move to archvive.
As soon as task will leave the FIST SECTION, the first one on the SECOND SECTION will climb into the FIRST SECTION.

SECOND SECTION:
This section will contain a list of tasks. Each task will be on a separate row and it will have in front 2 buttons. First button will be an arrow pointing up which will have the function to move up task by clicking and holding and pulling up or down the task. The second button will be a box that needs to be checked in case the task is finished before it got to be moved into the other section. Also, this task will move to archive.
